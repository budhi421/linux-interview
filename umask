The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permissions for newly created
files or directories. It can be used to control the default file or directory permissions for new files. It is
a four-digit octal number. The umask value for normal user is 0002 and the umask value for
root user is 0022.
So, the effected file permissions for normal users = 6 6 6 - 0 0 2 = 6 6 4.
The effected directory permissions for normal users = 7 7 7 - 0 0 2 = 7 7 5.

The effected file permissions for root user = 6 6 6 - 0 2 2 = 6 4 4
The effected directory permissions for root user = 7 7 7 - 0 2 2 = 7 5 5

how to check umask which is set
[root@managed-host ~]# umask
0022
[ansadmin@managed-host ~]$ umask
0022

you can check that it is set for both [normal user and root user] is same

Where you can set umask value
  --  vim /etc/bashrc

ek user bhi set kr sakta hai apana personal umask 
[ansadmin@managed-host ~]$ cat /etc/profile | grep umask
umask 0002
[ansadmin@managed-host ~]$ source /etc/profile
[ansadmin@managed-host ~]$ source /etc/profile      ---- reload 
[ansadmin@managed-host ~]$ umask
0002
abhi jo bhi normal user file or dir create karega uske profile based pe hoga...

NOTE: ydi umask root kewal set kiya hai means humne normal user ke through koi umask define nhin kiya hai toh wo root ke umask 
      se file or dir create hoga ...
      yadi normal user bhi umask define kr rkha hai toh kud ka umask pickup krega hai aur uske help se file create hoga.
